## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
1. Please load the homerange data `Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv`
2. Show the min, mean, and max log10.mass by taxonomic class in the dataset.
3. Make a plot that best summarizes this output.

```{r}
homerange <- read.csv("lab10_data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
homerange
```
```{r}
homerange_mass <- homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(log10_mass),
            min_mass = min(log10_mass),
            max_mass = max(log10_mass))
homerange_mass
```
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10_mass))+
  geom_boxplot()
```
