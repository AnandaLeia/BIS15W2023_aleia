## Ananda's BIS15 Repository Winter 2023
2023 is off! And I'm finally learning to code.

I'm a Systems and Synthetics Bio Major pushing through prerequisites at the moment. This repository is where I'll be posting homework assignments and coding projects for BIS 15L.

Current goal: create a Sunrise/Sunset calendar that I can input to my google calendar.
